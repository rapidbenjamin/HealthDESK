# HealthDESK - Using AI to ensure you are staying healthy at your desk

### Project Details

In order to help prevent the adverse effects of office work to peopleâ€™s health, we created HealthDESK, a website that uses AI technologies and webcam data to determine and notify you when you have poor posture, and also, remind you to maintain healthy habits while sitting at your desk.

### Hackathon

This project was submitted to [HackTheLib](http://www.hackthelib.com/) in July 2020 and won **"Most Scalable"** out of 205 participants.

## How We Built It

Using TensorFlow and OpenCV, we created an AI algorithm that can detect unhealthy habits that occur while sitting at your desk.  The AI implements a variety of Computer Vision algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks called ResNet-50 and MobileNet V2, along with a Cascade Classifier. After receiving bounding boxes and landmarks from these Computer Vision algorithms, we used mathematical computations to determine if a user is drinking water, stood up, touched their face, leaned in, and has bad posture.

In order to create the front end, we used JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. We used responsive CSS and custom JavaScript to create a simple yet powerful UI/UX design. We also implemented rapid push notifications that notifies users whenever they are being unhealthy, allowing users to keep the website running in the background.
